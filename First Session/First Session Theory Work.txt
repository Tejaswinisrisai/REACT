DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A LIBRARY AND FRAMEWORK :

Why is React known as React?
The name “React” reflects this reactive nature of the library.

The idea behind React is to build reusable components that can be rendered on the front-end, rather than writing a new piece of code every time you need to display something on the screen. This makes it easier and more efficient to build complex user interfaces.
